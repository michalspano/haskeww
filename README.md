# HaskeWW

Welcome to **HaskeWW**! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the power of
`Haskell`, a language often dismissed as purely academic or a toy for
researchers. Here, we aim to dispel that myth by demonstrating real-world,
practical software projects written in `Haskell`.

## Synopsis

*Haskeww* stands for "Haskell, but no Ls" - a playful nod to proving the critics
wrong. If you believe `Haskell` is just a toy language for academia - you may
rethink that.

interesting `Haskell` projects.
