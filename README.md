# HaskeWW

Welcome to **HaskeWW**! This repository is dedicated to showcasing the power of
`Haskell`, a language often dismissed as purely academic or a toy for
researchers. Here, we aim to dispel that myth by demonstrating real-world,
practical software projects written in `Haskell`.

## Synopsis

*Haskeww* stands for "Haskell, but no Ls" - a playful nod to proving the critics
wrong. If you believe `Haskell` is just a toy language for academia - you may
rethink that.

## Featured Projects

Below, you will find an alphabetically sorted list of links to various
interesting `Haskell` projects. 

### Projects
- [agda](https://github.com/agda/agda) - Agda is a dependently typed programming language / interactive theorem prover.
- [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) - Universal markup converter
- [xmonad](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad) - A dynamically tiling X11 window manager that is written and configured in Haskell.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a `Haskell` project that you believe
demonstrates the language's capabilities, follow [these steps](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Let's show the world what Haskell can really do!
